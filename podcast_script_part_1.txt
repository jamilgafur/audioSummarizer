This is a comprehensive survey on knowledge distillation of large language models (LLMs). Here's an overview of the main topics covered:

**Introduction**

The survey introduces the concept of knowledge distillation, which involves transferring knowledge from one model to another to improve the performance of a smaller model.

**Knowledge Elicitation**

The survey discusses various methods for eliciting knowledge from a teacher model, including:

1. Supervised fine-tuning
2. Context following alignment
3. Agent law (e.g., using demonstrations and rewards)
4. NLP task specialization

These methods aim to extract relevant information from the teacher model that can be used to improve the student model.

**Distillation Algorithm**

The survey explains various distillation algorithms, including:

1. Knowledge distillation
2. Self-knowledge
3. Rank optimization
4. Labeling expansion
5. Data curation

These algorithms aim to transfer knowledge from the teacher model to the student model while minimizing the loss of information.

**Applications and Vertical Domains**

The survey explores various applications and vertical domains where knowledge distillation can be applied, including:

1. NLP task specialization
2. Multi-modality (e.g., text and images)
3. Finance
4. Science
5. Skill domain divergence and similarity

**Knowledge Distillation Strategies**

The survey discusses various strategies for knowledge distillation, including:

1. Using open-source LLMs as teachers for self-improvement
2. Employing open-source LLMs as teachers to improve proprietary models
3. Using demonstrations and rewards to guide the student model

These strategies aim to enhance the capabilities of open-source LLMs while making them more accessible and cost-effective.

**Challenges and Gaps**

The survey identifies various challenges and gaps in knowledge distillation research, including:

1. Current methodologies
2. Challenges in ยง6 (e.g., data availability, computational requirements)
3. Opportunities for future work

**Conclusion and Future Work**

The survey concludes by synthesizing the insights gained from the literature review and identifying opportunities for future research. It proposes directions for future work, including:

1. Developing more efficient and effective knowledge distillation algorithms
2. Investigating the use of open-source LLMs as teachers for self-improvement
3. Exploring applications in various vertical domains

Overall, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of knowledge distillation in large language models, highlighting its potential and challenges. It serves as a guide for researchers and practitioners to explore new methodologies and strategies for improving the capabilities of open-source LLMs.
