=== I'd be delighted to help with writing teleprompt scripts for you.

What kind of content do you need the script for? Is it:

* A speech or presentation?
* An interview or Q&A session?
* A video commercial or promo?
* A corporate event or awards ceremony?

Please provide me with some details, and I'll get started on crafting a compelling teleprompt script that will engage your audience.

Also, would you like the script to be:

* Formal and professional
* Informal and conversational
* Short and snappy
* Long and detailed

Let me know, and I'll tailor the script to fit your needs! ===
I can provide a summary of the text in a format that is easier to read and understand.

**Knowledge Elicitation from Teacher LLMs**

Teacher LLMs (Large Language Models) are being used as teachers to elicit knowledge from students. This process involves using the teacher's capabilities to generate outputs for a given input, and then refining these outputs through various methods to improve their quality.

**Methods for Knowledge Elicitation**

There are several methods for knowledge elicitation, including:

1. **Labeling**: The teacher generates an output from the input.
2. **Expansion**: The teacher generates samples similar to the given demonstrations through in-context learning.
3. **Data Curation**: The teacher synthesizes data according to meta-information, such as a topic or an entity.
4. **Feature**: The data is fed into the teacher and extracted features are generated.
5. **Feedback**: The teacher provides feedback on the student's generations, such as preferences, corrections, expansions of challenging samples, etc.
6. **Self-Knowledge**: The student first generates outputs, which are then filtered for high quality or evaluated by the student itself.

**Formulation**

The knowledge elicitation process can be formulated as follows:

* Labeling: D(lab) = {(x, y) | x ∼ X, y ∼ pT(y|I ⊕ c ⊕ x)}
* Expansion: D(exp) = {(x, y) | x ∼ pT(x|I ⊕ c), y ∼ pT(y|I ⊕ x)}

These formulations highlight the use of teacher LLMs to generate new input-output pairs that are similar to the original demonstrations.
