The text discusses various research efforts in the field of instruction-following language models. Here are some key points:

1. **Evolving Instructions**: Researchers have proposed several methods to evolve instructions, such as using OpenAI ChatGPT data (Xuet et al., 2023b), distilling multi-turn knowledge from teacher LLMs (Chiang et al., 2023), and generating adaptive retrieval capabilities from teacher LLMs (Asai et al., 2023).
2. **Multi-Turn Dialogues**: Some research focuses on expanding conversational datasets through self-chat and using them to train smaller models (Xuet et al., 2023b; Ding et al., 2023b). For example, Xuet et al. (2023b) collect 111.5k dialogues from Quora and StackOverflow as seeds, resulting in the creation of a larger dataset called UltraChat.
3. **Self-Chat and Reranking**: Ye et al. (2023) enhance the quality of multi-turn data from ShareGPT by generating self-feedback on model responses and iteratively refining the responses based on received feedback.
4. **Rag Capabilities**: Asai et al. (2023) distill adaptive Rag capabilities from teacher LLMs into a small critic model, which determines whether retrieval is necessary and evaluates the quality of retrieved results.
5. **Fine-Tuning and Reranking**: Researchers have also explored fine-tuning student models using search-augmented instructions and Reranker (Wang et al., 2023c). The Reranker is trained to mimic how a retriever scores passages with rationales, with the goal of generating high-quality responses.

Overall, these research efforts aim to improve the multi-turn capabilities of instruction-following language models, including their ability to engage in conversations and generate accurate responses.
