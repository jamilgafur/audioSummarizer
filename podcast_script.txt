Good morning everyone, and thank you for your attention.

In recent years, there has been significant progress in leveraging teacher Large Language Models (LLMs) to create diverse and high-quality datasets for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

One promising technique is data curation through teacher LLMs. This approach involves collecting meta-information across multiple domains, such as Questions about the World, Creation and Generation, and Assistance on Existing Materials. By doing so, we can distill feature knowledge from teacher LLMs, which can be used to generate new datasets.

Several studies have explored this technique using different methods. For instance, UltraChat stands out for its ability to formulate feature knowledge in a way that leverages lexical and topical diversity. The UltraLLaMA model, fine-tuned on this data, consistently surpasses other open-source models.

Another notable series focuses on distilling smaller, high-quality datasets akin to "textbooks." Phi-1 experiments with synthesizing "textbook quality" data in the coding domain. Their approach involves distilling clear, self-contained, and instructive content from LLMs guided by random topics or function names.

These methods have shown promising results in various NLP tasks, including coding benchmarks like Hu-manEval and MBPP. The phi-1 model, despite its smaller size, outperforms all open-source models on these benchmarks.

Furthermore, researchers have introduced novel approaches to data curation through teacher LLMs. For example, MFTCoder uses hundreds of Python knowledge points as meta-information to create a CodeExercise Dataset. In contrast, Magicoder and WaveCoder get raw code collections from open-source datasets using this approach.

In the context of NLU tasks, certain studies explore the use of labels as meta-information for data augmentation or information retrieval tasks. These methods aim to preserve the original output distribution when quantizing LLMs, ensuring minimal loss of performance.

In conclusion, data curation through teacher LLMs has emerged as a promising technique for synthesizing high-quality and diverse datasets that are not only beneficial but also scalable in scale. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities of student models by leveraging the rich semantic and syntactic knowledge in intermediate layers of the teacher model.

Eliciting self-knowledge enables the student to refine its responses based on feedback. The student preference model can be created, and the student can also generate feedback. This knowledge uniquely circumvents the need for an external powerful model.

**Generalized Formulation for Eliciting Feedback Knowledge**

The knowledge could be elicited from the student itself using a generalized formulation: D(fb) ={(x,y,ϕ fb (x,y;θ T ))|x∼X,y ∼p S (y|x)}, where ϕ fb represents providing feedback from teacher LLMs.

**Conclusion**

Teacher-student models offer a more transparent and efficient way to transfer knowledge. By leveraging feature knowledge, teachers can provide extensive feedback on student performance. Eliciting self-knowledge enables the student to refine its responses, creating more autonomous learning systems.

SFT is a simple yet highly effective technique for refining student models. It involves fine-tuning the student model on a curated dataset of self-generated responses, employing an offline RL objective. SFT has been explored in many self-distillation works and has been found to be effective in improving student performance.

**Iterative Improvement**

SFT can be iteratively applied to improve student performance further. The Grow stage generates multiple output predictions, which are then ranked and filtered using a scoring function. The resulting dataset is used for fine-tuning the student model.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, SFT has emerged as a promising technique for improving LLMs on preference tasks. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it an attractive approach for further research and development.

The objective is to ensure that the student model not only produces similar outputs but also processes information in a comparable manner.

**Reinforcement Learning Optimization**

In the second stage, the student model's policy πθ is optimized to maximize the expected reward as per the trained reward model. Simultaneously, it minimizes the divergence from a reference policy πref, typically the initial policy of the teacher model. The RL objective is given by:

max E [r(x,y)] - βD[π(y|x) || π(y|x)]

**Ranking Optimization**

Ranking optimization presents a stable and computationally efficient alternative to traditional RL approaches. It directly incorporates ranking information into language models from a fixed preference dataset during fine-tuning. This method updates the policy to increase the relative likelihood of preferred responses, making the process more stable and efficient.

**Agent and NLP Task Specialization**

The Agent concept highlights the autonomous nature of LLMs, while NLP Task Specialization showcases their versatility in specializing across various Natural Language Processing tasks. Context Following focuses on the student's ability to comprehend and respond effectively to input information, aligning its output with teacher responses.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this presentation explores the concept of skill distillation in language models using reinforcement learning optimization techniques.

Ladies and gentlemen, today we'll be discussing a crucial aspect of instruction-following language models: distilling instruction data from teachers.

This process involves enhancing and scoring instructions in three key areas: complexity, quality, and diversity. Researchers have proposed various methods to achieve this, such as InstructionFusion and MUFFIN, which focus on increasing the complexity of instructions by fusing two distinct evolved instructions. Additionally, these approaches use teacher LLMs to create high-quality distillation data.

Another promising technique is selective reflection tuning, which involves selecting a student model with novel student selection module capabilities. This approach has shown impressive performance in handling diverse input facets and tasks.

However, it's essential to acknowledge that models trained on natural conversations might mimic the style but not fully capture the reasoning process of the original teacher. To address this issue, researchers have proposed system instructions that encourage student models to grasp the reasoning process, such as Orca and Orca 2.

Moreover, multi-turn dialogue presents a vital skill for models to engage meaningfully in human-like conversations and respond coherently over successive dialogue turns. Researchers have dedicated works to training small chat models by distilling multi-turn knowledge from teacher LLMs.

One promising approach is SAIL, which starts by retrieving search results using search APIs, creating augmented instructions that include both the instruction and grounding information. By inputting each retrieved passage along with the ground truth response into an entailment model, researchers can label each retrieval result for relevance. These search-augmented instructions are then fed into teacher LLMs for generating responses.

ShareGPT serves as a platform for users to share their conversations with ChatGPT, offering a vast repository of multi-turn conversations readily available. Some small chat models have been trained using this data to acquire the capability to engage in multi-turn dialogues.

In conclusion, distilling instruction data from teachers presents a promising avenue for training cheap and reproducible instruction-following language models. By leveraging various techniques, such as InstructionFusion, selective reflection tuning, and SAIL, researchers can create more accurate and informative student models that prioritize the reasoning process and engage meaningfully in human-like conversations.

Here is a rewritten version of the text in a concise and clear format:

**Advances in Multi-Turn Conversational AI**

Recent research has focused on improving multi-turn conversational models. One approach involves using self-chat datasets to train smaller models. For instance, Xuetal. (2023b) initiated their work by collecting 111.5k dialogues through self-chat, resulting in the creation of a significantly larger dataset called UltraChat.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

To enhance the capabilities of student models, researchers have explored Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This method involves using a retriever to identify relevant passages and then fine-tuning the model on those passages. Ye et al. (2023) enhanced this approach by generating self-feedback on model responses and iteratively refining them based on feedback.

**Adaptive RAG Capabilities**

To equip student models with adaptive RAG capabilities, researchers have proposed distilling this ability from teacher LLMs into a small critic model. Asai et al. (2023) demonstrated that this critic model can determine whether retrieval is necessary and evaluate the quality of retrieved results by generating 'reflection tokens.'

**Aligning Teacher Models to Student Responses**

Most existing methods focus on directly aligning student responses to teacher models. However, these approaches might suffer from imitating response style but not reasoning process. To address this issue, researchers have proposed novel thinking patterns that go beyond pure imitation.

**Challenges with LLMs**

LLMs are known to lack the ability to utilize up-to-date knowledge and often produce responses containing factual inaccuracies due to their sole reliance on parametric knowledge. This has motivated research into developing more robust conversational models.

**Multi-Turn Benchmarks**

The MT-Bench is a multi-turn question set where LLMs like GPT-4 are evaluated. Researchers have proposed various approaches to improve the performance of these models, including fine-tuning and refinement techniques.

**Current State and Future Directions**

Recent research has made significant progress in developing more effective conversational models. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing challenges with LLMs and refining teacher-student alignment methods.
