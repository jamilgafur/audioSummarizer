This is a detailed summary of various research papers on self-supervised learning (SSL) for language models, particularly those using knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. Here's a concise overview:

**Knowledge Distillation (KD)**: KD involves training a student model on the output of a pre-trained teacher model to learn its knowledge and reduce its capacity.

**Divergence**: Divergence measures how different two probability distributions are. In the context of SSL, divergence is used to quantify how well the student model aligns with the teacher model's knowledge.

**Similarity Functions**: Different similarity functions are employed in various papers to measure the similarity between the output of the teacher and student models.

Some key concepts and techniques discussed:

1. **Contrasting Prompts**: Contrasting prompts are used to generate preference pairs from an unaligned language model.
2. **Self-Generated Data**: Self-generated data is curated by ranking and filtering self-generated outputs from the student model.
3. **Offline RL Objective**: The offline RL objective involves fine-tuning the student model on a curated dataset of self-generated responses.
4. **SFT (Student Teacher Fine-Tuning)**: SFT involves fine-tuning the student model on the output of the teacher model to minimize the KL divergence between their probability distributions.

**Applications and Extensions**:

1. **Improve Stage**: In this stage, the student model generates multiple output predictions, which are then ranked and filtered.
2. **Grow Stage**: During the Grow stage, the student model generates multiple output predictions, which are then fine-tuned using an offline RL objective.
3. **Self-Play**: Self-Play involves training the language model in a self-supervised manner, where the teacher model is used to guide the learning process.

**Recent Developments and Future Directions**:

1. **Novel Approaches**: Novel approaches like Self-Rewarding, which uses the language model itself as a reward model, have been explored.
2. **Iterative DPO**: Iterative DPO involves training the language model in an iterative manner, where the teacher model is used to guide the learning process.

**Summary**:

This summary provides an overview of various research papers on self-supervised learning for language models using knowledge distillation techniques. The papers discuss different approaches to measuring divergence and similarity between the output of the teacher and student models. The techniques employed include contrasting prompts, self-generated data, offline RL objective, SFT, and iterative DPO. These approaches have been explored in various applications, including sentence summarization, question answering, and text classification. Future directions involve exploring novel approaches and extending existing techniques to tackle new challenges in natural language processing.
