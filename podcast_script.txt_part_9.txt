=== I'd be delighted to help! As a professional teleprompt script writer, I can assist with writing engaging and informative scripts for TV hosts, anchors, news programs, corporate events, live broadcasts, and more.

What type of project do you need assistance with? Would you like me to:

1. Write a script for a specific event or presentation?
2. Revise an existing script to improve clarity or tone?
3. Develop a script for a newscast or broadcast program?
4. Create a script for a corporate video, training session, or product launch?

Please provide some details about the project, such as:

* The topic or theme of the event or presentation
* The target audience and their demographics
* Any specific tone or style requirements (e.g., serious, conversational, humorous)
* Any existing guidelines or brand voice guidelines

I'll be happy to help you craft a compelling and effective script! ===
Based on the provided text, here is a summary of the key points related to distilling instruction data and training instruction-following language models:

**Distilling Instruction Data**

1. **Human conversations**: Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) and Koala (Genget al., 2023) showcase impressive performance by using human conversations and natural instructions from community-contributed conversations.
2. **ShareGPT platform**: ShareGPT serves as a platform for users to share their multi-turn conversations with ChatGPT, offering a vast repository of multi-turn conversations readily available.
3. **Search-augmented instructions**: SAIL (Luo et al., 2023c) starts by retrieving search results using search APIs, creating search-augmented instructions that include both the instruction and grounding information.

**Training Instruction-Following Language Models**

1. **Multi-turn dialogue**: Extending single-instance command execution to comprehend and maintain context through ongoing interactions.
2. **Small chat models**: Trained on instruction data expanded by ChatGPT or using ShareGPT conversations, these small chat models acquire the capability for engaging in multi-turn dialogues.
3. **Teacher LLMs**: Used as a source of instruction data, teacher LLMs (like GPT-4) are fine-tuned to generate responses and provide relevance labels.
4. **Rationale distillation**: KARD (Kang et al., 2023b) distills rationales r from the teacher LLM in response to questions x, which are then utilized to train two models: a student LM and a Reranker.

**Key Takeaways**

1. Distilling instruction data from human conversations or teacher LLMs is a promising approach for training cheap and reproducible instruction-following language models.
2. Multi-turn dialogue skills are vital for models to engage meaningfully in human-like conversations and respond coherently over successive dialogue turns.
3. Search-augmented instructions and rationale distillation techniques can improve the performance of instruction-following language models.

Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any of these points!
